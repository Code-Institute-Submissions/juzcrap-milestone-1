# Project 1
This website represents a growing real estate company that assists customers in the sale and purchase of their homes.

## UX
Direct link to the site: https://juzcrap.github.io/milestone-1/

Site is currently defined into 3 active page:
1. Home page - a brief introduction of what the company does
2. Agents page - an image gallery of who the agents are
3. Contacts page - page allowing users to make any contact/queries direct to the agency

## Features
The site has a common navbar across all active pages.
- the navbar collapses in mobile view
- clicking on the house icon should always bring one back to the homepage

### Existing Features
* All contact or input box submit should lead to the contact page
* Cards should collapse one over another in the mobile view
* Carousel on the homepage should collapse to hide images in mobile view

### Features to implement
* Links to buy/sell selections in navbar
* Layout on ipad and ipad pros

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap for overall responsiveness of site pages
  * Navbar
  * Jumbtron
  * Cards
  * Carousel
- Javascript for user input in page footer

## Testing
- Code was originally written and tested locally using Visual Studio Code 
- Initial draft code was then loaded into AWS cloud9 for pushing into github
- Once published in github, different mobile platforms (iphone, android phones, ipads) were used to access the site to check mainly alignment of components
- For a short period of time, white space existed to the right side of the Agents and Contact pages although the same skeleton codes were used to create the navbar, jumbtron and footer containers.
  * Issue has since been resolved. Cause of issue - unknown.
- Code works well current for most devices except ipad and ipad pro devies

- Javascript for user input in footer section was tested with various inputs
  * Javascript works well to allow only active "Submit" button if email address takes the correct input format

## Deployment
- After initial code was drafted and available in AWS cloud9, the IDE was linked to github with an initial commit
- An update was pushed to github when images were carded on the Agents page
- A final push/update will be done once all font stylings and responsive alignment is corrected locally and with a final copy of readme file
